     * The Play secret.
     *
     * We want to:
     *
     * 1) Encourage the practice of *not* using the same secret in dev and prod.
     * 2) Make it obvious that the secret should be changed.
     * 3) Ensure that in dev mode, the secret stays stable across restarts.
     * 4) Ensure that in dev mode, sessions do not interfere with other applications that may be or have been running
     *   on localhost.  Eg, if I start Play app 1, and it stores a PLAY_SESSION cookie for localhost:9000, then I stop
     *   it, and start Play app 2, when it reads the PLAY_SESSION cookie for localhost:9000, it should not see the
     *   session set by Play app 1.  This can be achieved by using different secrets for the two, since if they are
     *   different, they will simply ignore the session cookie set by the other.
     *
     * To achieve 1 and 2, we will, in Activator templates, set the default secret to be "changeme".  This should make
     * it obvious that the secret needs to be changed and discourage using the same secret in dev and prod.
     *
     * For safety, if the secret is not set, or if it's changeme, and we are in prod mode, then we will fail fatally.
     * This will further enforce both 1 and 2.
     *
     * To achieve 3, if in dev or test mode, if the secret is either changeme or not set, we will generate a secret
     * based on the location of application.conf.  This should be stable across restarts for a given application.
     *
     * To achieve 4, using the location of application.conf to generate the secret should ensure this.
